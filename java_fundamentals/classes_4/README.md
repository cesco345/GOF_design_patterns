# The Concept of Classes and its implementation

1.  Coupling in software engineering refers to the degree of interdependence between modules or components within a system. High coupling implies strong dependencies between components, making the system less flexible, harder to maintain, and more difficult to understand. Low coupling, on the other hand, implies loose dependencies, leading to more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. In summary, low coupling promotes modularization, reusability, and maintainability by reducing the dependencies between components, whereas high coupling can lead to code that is harder to understand, modify, and maintain.
