# Lambda Expressions in Java

Lambda expressions in Java are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allow you to treat functionality as a method argument, or to create anonymous functions. Lambda expressions provide a concise way to express instances of single-method interfaces (also known as functional interfaces). They improve the readability and maintainability of code by reducing the verbosity of anonymous inner classes.

Here are some key points about lambda expressions in Java:

1.  ***Syntax:*** Lambda expressions have a compact syntax that consists of parameters, an arrow (->), and a body. The parameters are enclosed in parentheses, and the body can be either a single expression or a block of code.

(parameters) -> expression
or
(parameters) -> { statements; }


2.  ***Functional Interfaces:*** Lambda expressions are primarily used to implement instances of functional interfaces, which are interfaces that contain exactly one abstract method. The lambda expression provides the implementation of this abstract method.
interface MyInterface {
    void myMethod();
}

MyInterface myObj = () -> System.out.println("Lambda expression");

3.  ***Type Inference:*** Java's compiler can infer the types of lambda parameters from the context, so you often don't need to specify them explicitly. However, you can specify the types if needed.

(int x, int y) -> x + y

4.  ***Target Typing***: Lambda expressions are compatible with any functional interface whose abstract method's parameter types and return type match the lambda expression's parameter types and return type.

Comparator<String> comp = (s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2);

5.  ***Functional Interfaces in Java API:*** Java 8 introduced several new functional interfaces in the java.util.function package, such as Predicate, Function, Consumer, and Supplier, to support lambda expressions in various contexts.

Lambda expressions allow for more expressive and flexible code, especially when working with collections, concurrency, and event handling. They promote a functional programming style in Java and are widely used in modern Java development.

# The Concept of Lazy Evaluation in Java
Lazy evaluation is a programming technique where an expression is not evaluated until its value is actually needed. In Java, lazy evaluation is often achieved using constructs such as lambda expressions, streams, and deferred execution mechanisms.

Here are some key points about lazy evaluation in Java:

1.  ***Deferred Execution:*** Lazy evaluation defers the execution of an expression until its result is explicitly requested. This can help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary computations.
Lazy Loading: Lazy evaluation is commonly used in scenarios where the computation of a value is expensive or resource-intensive. By deferring the computation until the value is needed, lazy evaluation can help reduce unnecessary overhead.
2.  ***Lambda Expressions***: Lambda expressions in Java facilitate lazy evaluation by allowing the delayed execution of code blocks. The body of a lambda expression is executed only when the functional interface's method is invoked.
Streams: Java streams support lazy evaluation, where intermediate operations are typically fused together and executed only when a terminal operation is invoked. This allows for efficient processing of large datasets without the need to store intermediate results in memory.
3.  ***Supplier Interface:*** The java.util.function.Supplier interface represents a supplier of results, allowing lazy evaluation to be explicitly implemented. The get() method of a Supplier is called to obtain the result, triggering the evaluation if it has not been done already.
4.  ***Optimization:*** Lazy evaluation can be used to optimize memory usage and improve performance by deferring the computation of values until they are actually needed. This can be particularly beneficial in functional programming paradigms where transformations are applied to data streams.

Overall, lazy evaluation is a powerful technique in Java that promotes efficiency and resource optimization by delaying the evaluation of expressions until their results are required. It is commonly used in various contexts, including functional programming, data processing, and optimization of resource usage.
