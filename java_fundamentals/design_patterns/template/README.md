# The Template Method Design Pattern

The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in software engineering. It defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

Here's how it typically works:

1. **Abstract Class**: This is a class that contains the template method, which defines the overall algorithm structure by calling abstract methods or hooks that subclasses must implement or override.

2. **Concrete Classes**: These are the subclasses that extend the abstract class and provide specific implementations for the abstract methods or hooks defined in the abstract class.

3. **Template Method**: This is a method in the abstract class that defines the algorithm's structure using a series of method calls. It may include some steps that are implemented directly in the abstract class and other steps that are deferred to subclasses.

4. **Abstract Methods or Hooks**: These are methods declared in the abstract class but without any implementation. Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for these methods.

When to use it:

- When you want to define the overall structure of an algorithm but allow subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps.
- When you have multiple classes that share common behavior but have some variations in certain steps of the algorithm.
- When you want to avoid code duplication by centralizing common behavior in a superclass.

For example, consider a class representing a document converter. The Template Method pattern could be used to define a common algorithm for converting documents to different formats. The abstract class provides a template method that defines the overall conversion process, while concrete subclasses implement specific methods for handling different types of documents (e.g., text, images) and formats (e.g., PDF, HTML). This way, the overall conversion process remains consistent across different document types, while allowing for variations in the conversion steps.
