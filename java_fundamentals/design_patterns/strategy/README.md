# The Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in software engineering. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows a client to choose an algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime without altering the client's code structure.

Here's how it typically works:

**Strategy Interface**: This is an interface or an abstract class that declares a method (or methods) common to all supported algorithms. It serves as a contract for all concrete strategy classes to implement.

**Concrete Strategies**: These are the concrete implementations of the strategy interface. Each concrete strategy encapsulates a specific algorithm.

**Context**: This is a class that maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to the strategy object. The context class allows clients to choose and switch between different strategies dynamically at runtime.

When to use it:

- When you want to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- When you have a class that uses multiple conditional statements to implement different variations of an algorithm, and you want to decouple these variations from the class.
- When you want to hide the implementation details of an algorithm from the client code.

For example, consider a sorting application that needs to support different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, quicksort, and merge sort. Instead of embedding all sorting algorithms within the sorting class, you can use the Strategy pattern. Each sorting algorithm becomes a separate strategy class implementing a common interface. The sorting class then delegates the sorting task to a strategy object, allowing clients to choose the desired sorting algorithm dynamically.
