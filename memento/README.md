The Memento design pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in software engineering. It's used to capture and externalize an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

Here's how it typically works:

1.  Originator: This is the object whose state needs to be saved. It creates a Memento object containing a snapshot of its current state.

2.  Memento: This is the object that stores the state of the Originator. It has methods for retrieving the saved state and possibly modifying it (depending on the implementation).

3.  Caretaker: This is responsible for keeping track of the Memento but doesn't operate on or examine its contents. It only saves, retrieves, and passes Mementos.

When to use it:

- When you need to save and restore the state of an object.
- When you want to provide an undo mechanism in your application.
- When you need a snapshot of an object's state at a particular point in time.
- For example, imagine you're writing a text editor. You can use the Memento pattern to implement the "undo" functionality. The Originator would represent the text editor with its current content, the Memento would store the state of the text, and the Caretaker would manage the stack of Mementos allowing the user to revert to previous states of the text.
