# The State Design Pattern

The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in software engineering. It allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The pattern achieves this by encapsulating the states of the object into separate classes and delegating the state-specific behavior to these classes.

Here's how it typically works:

1.  **Context**: This is the class that contains the state. It also maintains a reference to the current state object and delegates state-specific behavior to this object.

2.  **State**: This is an interface or an abstract class that defines a set of methods for each state-specific behavior. Concrete state classes implement this interface and provide the actual implementation for each behavior.

3.  **Concrete State**: These are the classes that implement the State interface. Each concrete state class represents a specific state of the Context object and provides the implementation for the behavior associated with that state.

When to use it:

- When an object's behavior depends on its state, and it needs to change its behavior at runtime based on that state.
- When you have multiple conditional statements that depend on the object's state, leading to complex and hard-to-maintain code.
- When you want to avoid using a large number of conditional statements to control an object's behavior.

For example, consider a vending machine. It can be in different states like "Ready," "Dispensing," or "Out of Stock." Each state affects how the vending machine responds to user actions like inserting coins or selecting an item. By using the State pattern, you can represent each state as a separate class and simplify the logic for handling user interactions and state transitions.
